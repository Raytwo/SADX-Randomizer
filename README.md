SADX Randomizer
==============

Sonic Adventure DX Randomizer is a mod for the PC Disc and Steam version (with BetterSADX) of Sonic Adventure DX. This mod load random characters into random stages in a random order with some custom layout to make them beatable.

Note: I do not recommend using the Dreamcast Conversion mod with the Randomizer, as it can add some bugs.

Download
--------

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Sora-yx/SADX-Randomizer/releases)

Installation
------------

1) Make sure you have the SADX Mod Loader downloaded and installed from [this link](http://info.sonicretro.org/SADX_Mod_Loader).
- If you are using the Steam version, do not use that link, you must install better sadx from [this link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=299808681), this will also install the mod manager.
2) Make sure to extract the Mod Loader's contents into your main SADX folder.
 - Once all Mod Loader's files and folders are there, run ModManager and click on 'Install Loader'
3) You should now have a "mods" folder in your SADX folder!
4) Download the latest version of SADX Randomizer and place the entire folder in the mods folder.
5) If all the above steps have been done properly, you should be able to run SADXModManager and select Randomizer in the list.
 - To configure options for SADX Randomizer, select the mod in ModManager and click on 'Configure...' to see all the options. (It is recommened to keep "have all upgrades" activated, since upgrades help to finish some specific stage or boss.)
6) If you want to race with a friend, make sure both of you are using the same "seed" in the settings, also make sure the seed used is different than "0". (0 makes the rng always different, when using another number makes it consistent.)
7) Clic on Save and play!

Enjoy!

Big thanks to Raytwo for the help with the code in general. Since I'm very new to programming, this project couldn't be a thing without him.

Also thanks to Prahaha and Kell for the various tips.
